/**
 * The platform command that hands a URL to the desktop's default handler.
 *
 * ## Windows: why the URL must be a quoted literal *and* verbatim
 *
 * The natural spelling — `cmd /c start "" <url>` — is broken for any URL with
 * more than one query parameter, because **`cmd.exe` treats `&` as a command
 * separator**. It splits the URL at the first `&` and runs the rest as
 * commands:
 *
 * ```
 * in : https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=ABC&state=XYZ
 * out: https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/authorize?response_type=code
 *      'client_id' is not recognized as an internal or external command
 * ```
 *
 * An OAuth authorize URL is exactly that shape, so the browser landed on the
 * endpoint with no `client_id`, no PKCE challenge and no state.
 *
 * Two things together fix it, and both are required:
 *
 * 1. the URL is wrapped in double quotes, which is what keeps `&` away from
 *    cmd's parser; and
 * 2. `windowsVerbatimArguments` makes Node pass the argv through untouched —
 *    with the default quoting, Node rewrites the command line and undoes (1).
 *
 * Verified by loopback probe: the browser's request line carried all four
 * query parameters intact. The same probe rejected the alternatives —
 * `powershell Start-Process '<url>'` exits 0 without opening anything, which
 * is exactly the kind of silent no-op that would have shipped as "fixed".
 *
 * `open` (macOS) and `xdg-open` (Linux) receive the URL as plain argv with no
 * shell involved, so `&` is already inert there.
