[中文](README.md) · **English**

Bridges **Atlassian's official remote MCP server** into
[DeepSeek Harness](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@deepseek-ai/dsh). After a single browser
authorization, the Jira, Confluence, Jira Service Management, Bitbucket and Compass tools appear as
native tools in the agent's tool list:

```
mcp__atlassian__getJiraIssue
mcp__atlassian__createJiraIssue
mcp__atlassian__searchConfluenceUsingCql
```

![Settings → Atlassian](assets/settings-page.png)

The DSH built-in `dsh-mcp-client` has no OAuth support, and API-token auth forces an explicit
`cloudId` on every tool call. This plugin supplies the missing piece over OAuth 2.1 — the site
follows from the authorization, so no `cloudId` is ever passed.

## Install

```sh
dsh plugin --profile desktop add github:zhenyong97/dsh-plugin-atlassian
```

**Restart that profile afterwards.** Replace `desktop` with the profile you actually use.

## Connect Atlassian

1. Open **Settings → Atlassian**
2. Click **Connect Atlassian**
3. Approve the request on Atlassian's authorization page, **choosing the site to authorize**
4. The status becomes **Connected**, and Settings lists the site and the tools it exposes

![The entry in the settings nav](assets/settings-nav.png)

The settings page at the top of this README is that connected state: the site row shows whichever site
you authorized, and the tool count on this machine was 32. If the authorization page does not open by
itself, Settings shows a clickable authorization link. If the flow gets stuck, click **Disconnect**
and reconnect.

Once connected, just ask the agent in plain language:

- "List the open issues assigned to me in the PROJ project"
- "Break this requirement into 5 subtasks under PROJ-123"
- "Write up these meeting notes as a Confluence page in the Engineering space"
- "Find Confluence pages tagged release-notes and summarise this week's changes"

## How to use it

### 1. Open the Jira board

After authorizing, the sidebar gains a Jira icon; click it to open the board. It reads the same MCP
connection, so it needs no extra token or cloudId configuration:

![The Jira board](assets/jira-board.png)

- **Columns are statuses.** Every Jira status is a column, ordered by status category (to do → in
  progress → done); within a category they are ordered by name, so a refresh never reshuffles the
  columns.
- **Filter by project.** The project chips are derived from the issues the current query actually
  returned, each carrying its count — so clicking one cannot land on an empty project. Click again
  to clear it, or use **Clear filters** to reset everything at once.
- **Filter by status category.** The to do / in progress / done chips carry counts too, and combine
  with the project filter as AND.
- **The search box** matches substrings in the key, the summary and the project name, entirely
  client-side, so it issues no requests.
- **View switch.** "In progress" excludes completed issues (the default, so a long backlog cannot
  bury the work in flight); "All" includes them.
- **The JQL is shown and editable**, and takes effect on Enter — the JQL *is* the board's real
  state, and hiding it turns "the issue count looks wrong" into a bug report. Once edited, a
  **Reset** appears to return to the selected view.
- The status spine down the left of each card, the project chip at its foot, and the totals in the
  header are all there to be read at a glance.
- The board refreshes itself every 60 seconds, skipping while the page is hidden; the footer says
  whether the per-fetch limit was reached.

### 2. Read an issue and confirm a transition

**Click any card** and the drawer opens on the right: the description (rendered Markdown), priority,
assignee, project, and the **status transitions the server currently offers** — the buttons are
exactly what the server returned, never a guess. The drawer header is sticky, so the buttons stay
reachable while you scroll a long description.

![The issue drawer and its transitions](assets/board-detail.png)

A transition is applied when you confirm it in the drawer; the agent side is explicitly told not to
change issue status on its own.

### 3. Hand an issue to an agent

**Right-click any card** to open the menu and choose a destination in place:

![The hand-over menu](assets/board-handoff.png)

| Menu item | What it does |
|---|---|
| **New session (current workspace)** | Opens a session in the current / most recent workspace and delivers there |
| **Send to current session** | Queues into the session you already have open, without interrupting what it is doing |
| **Expand a workspace → ＋ New session** | Opens a session in that workspace and delivers there |
| **Expand a workspace → a session** | Delivers into that existing session (running ones first) |
| **Copy prompt** | Copies to the clipboard only; you decide where it goes |

Delivery leaves you **on the board** with the confirmation in place, so you can hand over the next
batch straight away; the target session is one click away in the sidebar.

The instruction comes from `board.promptTemplate` (`{{key}}` / `{{summary}}` are substituted). The
built-in template is deliberately constrained: read the code before editing, change only what this
task needs, show checkable evidence, and **explicitly tell the agent not to change the Jira workflow
itself** — status transitions stay your call on the board. A custom template is written per issue,
so a batch hand-over generates one per issue.

### 4. Select several and hand them over in one go

`Shift+click` selects the range from the previous card, in the order you see them (left to right,
top to bottom). As soon as anything is selected, the cards grow checkboxes and a batch bar appears
at the foot of the panel:

![Multi-select and the batch bar](assets/board-selection.png)

Several issues can go to the same session, or into a new one — they are combined into **one** prompt
rather than several interleaved ones.

Cards can also be dragged onto the Jira icon in the sidebar: dropping them selects the issues you
dragged and opens the same menu for you to confirm the target.

## Tools you will get

After authorizing, these appear in the agent's tool list as `mcp__atlassian__<name>`. Which ones are
actually available depends on the products you can reach on the site you authorized:

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `searchJiraIssuesUsingJql` | Search issues with JQL |
| `getJiraIssue` | Read a single issue |
| `createJiraIssue` | Create an issue |
| `getVisibleJiraProjects` | List the Jira projects you can see |
| `getTransitionsForJiraIssue` | List the available status transitions for an issue |
| `searchConfluenceUsingCql` | Search Confluence with CQL |
| `getConfluencePage` | Read a page |
| `createConfluencePage` / `updateConfluencePage` | Create / update a page |
| `atlassianUserInfo` | The authorized account |
| `getAccessibleAtlassianResources` | The sites this authorization can reach |

## Configuration

The defaults work out of the box. To change one, override by `id: atlassian` in your profile's
`cordis.patch.yml`:

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `serverName` | `atlassian` | Tool-name prefix: `mcp__<serverName>__<tool>` |
| `redirectPort` | `3334` | OAuth callback port — keep it stable |
| `expectedSite` | empty | When set, the authorized site is checked and a mismatch reported |
| `autoOpenBrowser` | `true` | Open the browser when **Connect Atlassian** is clicked |
| `board.jql` | empty | JQL the board opens with; empty selects the built-in "in progress" view (excludes done) |
| `board.limit` | `50` | Issues fetched per refresh (the server caps a page at 100) |
| `board.timeoutMs` | `90000` | Deadline for one board read |
| `board.promptTemplate` | empty | Instruction sent when an issue is handed to an agent; empty selects the built-in template |

Remaining fields and the full defaults are in `cordis.patch.yml`.

> ⚠️ A patch **replaces the row's whole `config`** rather than merging, so restate the other
> fields when you override.

## Uninstall

```sh
dsh plugin --profile desktop remove dsh-plugin-atlassian
```

The stored authorization lives in `$DSH_HOME/.dsh-atlassian/` — delete it too.

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary>No Atlassian page in Settings</summary>

The profile has no web server service, or the plugin did not take effect with the profile restart.
Look for warnings prefixed with `atlassian:` in the startup log.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Stuck at "Authorization required" / the browser never opened</summary>

Use the authorization link shown in Settings. If `redirectPort` is taken, the plugin falls back to
a temporary port and re-registers automatically. If the flow is truly stuck, click **Disconnect**
to clear the token and reconnect.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Connected, but the tool count is 0</summary>

The server returned no tools, usually a site permission issue — confirm the site you authorized
gives access to the products you expect.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Settings reports a site mismatch</summary>

The `expectedSite` you configured does not match the site actually authorized. The tools still
work; they just point at the site Settings shows. Fix `expectedSite` or re-authorize. **This is a
notice, not a block.**
</details>

## Known limitations

- Tools only — MCP Resources and Prompts are not supported yet
- Image results render as placeholder text
- The Settings nav icon is patched in place (DSH exposes no icon interface); if the patch does not
  match, the default gear stays
- A `expectedSite` mismatch is not a hard block

## Development

```sh
npm install && npm run build   # tsc(host) + tsc(client) + bundle the client
```

Verifying on a scratch profile, the two regression scripts, and the README / storefront capture flow
are covered in `dev/README.md`.
